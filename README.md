5 Nov 2014. A project to:
* Learn how to put the Intertoobs together - i.e. feed live/API data into a `d3.js` chart.
* Make it user-interactive, because hooray!
* Learn a new `d3.js` visualization. 

### To Do
1. Style the ugly buttons.
2. Clean up general file, which is a mess.
3. Figure out if there's a reason and way to hide (?) the API key. Or does no one care?
4. Can I pull two JSONs at once? Nested `d3.json` pulls?
5. Merging artist tags with track/artists (ringed donut).
6. Second level (outer ring) tooltip on artists: pics.
